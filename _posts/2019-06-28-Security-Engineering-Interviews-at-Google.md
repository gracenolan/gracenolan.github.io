title: Security Engineering Interviews at Google - Nolang's Study Notes
---

I am a security engineer at Google and these are the notes from when I was studying for the interviews. This is my first job in security and a lot of people have asked me how I studied. My notes consist mostly of a list of terms and technologies to learn, plus little tidbits that helped me remember certain details. At the end are interview tips I made for myself and that I find myself saying to others looking to interview.

**If you are less confident at coding**:  
Spend more time writing small scrips and studying features of your preferred language. Coding is essential (even if you don't like it or you don't use it much in your current role). I have a section on coding in this list.

**If you are less confident at security topics**:  
I recommend doing a lot of reading and whenever you come across a term you are unfamiliar with or couldn't easily explain, then add it to the list.

# Networking 

OSI Model
*  Application; layer 7 (and basically layers 5 & 6) (includes API, HTTP, etc).
*  Transport; layer 4 (TCP/UDP).
*  Network; layer 3 (Routing).
*  Datalink; layer 2 (Error checking and frame synchronisation).
*  Physical; layer 1 (bits over fibre).

Broadcast domains and collision domains. 

Firewalls
*  Rules to prevent incoming and outgoing connections.

NAT 
*  Useful to understand IPv4 vs IPv6.

DNS
*  (53)
*  Requests to DNS are usually UDP, unless the server gives a redirect notice asking for a TCP connection. Look up in cache happens first. DNS exfiltration. Using raw IP addresses means no DNS logs, but there are HTTP logs. DNS sinkholes.
*  In a reverse DNS lookup, PTR might contain*  2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa, which will map to  208.80.152.2. DNS lookups start at the end of the string and work backwards, which is why the IP address is backwards in PTR.

DNS exfiltration 
*  Sending data as subdomains. 
*  26856485f6476a567567c6576e678.badguy.com

## Mitigations 
Data Execution Prevention

Address space layout randomisation
*  To make it harder for buffer overruns to execute privileged instructions at known addresses in memory.

Principle of least privilege
*  Eg running Internet Explorer with the Administrator SID disabled in the process token. Reduces the ability of buffer overrun exploits to run as elevated user.

Code signing
*  Requiring kernel mode code to be digitally signed.

Patching 

Compiler security features
*  Use of compilers that trap buffer overruns.

Encryption
*  Of software and/or firmware components.

Mandatory Access Controls
*  (MACs)
*  Operating systems with Mandatory Access Controls - eg. SELinux.

"Insecure by exception"
*  When to allow people to do certain things for their job, and how to improve everything else. Don't try to "fix" security, just improve it by 99%.

Do not blame the user
*  Security is about protecting people, we should build technology that people can trust, not constantly blame users. 


# Cryptography, authentication, identity 

Encryption vs Encoding vs Hashing vs Obfuscation vs Signing
*  Be able to explain the differences between these things. 

Encryption standards + implementations
*  RSA (asymmetrical).
*  AES (symmetrical).
*  ECC (namely ed25519) (asymmetric). 
*  Chacha/Salsa (symmetric).

Cyphers - Block vs stream 

Asymmetric vs symmetric
*  Asymmetric is slow, but good for establishing a trusted connection.
*  Symmetric has a shared key and is faster. Protocols often use asymmetric to transfer symmetric key.
*  Perfect forward secrecy - eg Signal uses this.

Trusted Platform Module 
*  (TPM)
*  Trusted storage for certs and auth data locally on device/host.

Hashing functions 
*  MD5, Sha-1), BLAKE.

*  Entropy buffer draining.
*  Methods of filling entropy buffer.

Certificates 
*  What info do certs contain, how are they signed? 
*  Look at DigiNotar.

O-auth

Auth Cookies
*  Client side.

Sessions 
*  Server side.

Auth systems 
*  SAMLv2o.
*  OpenID.

Biometrics
*  Can't rotate unlike passwords.

Password management
*  Rotating passwords (and why this is bad). 
*  Different password lockers. 

U2F / FIDO
*  Eg. Yubikeys.

Network 
*  Nmap.
*  Find CVEs for any services running.
*  Interception attacks.
*  Getting unsecured info over the network.

Remote Control
*  Remote code execution and privilege.
*  Bind shell (opens port and waits for attacker).

Look at mitre attack matrix
*  https://attack.mitre.org/

# Detection

IDS
*  Intrusion Detection System (signature based (eg. snot) or behaviour based).

SIEM
*  System Information and Event Management.

IOC 
*  Indicator of compromise (often shared amongst orgs/groups).

Things that create signals
*  Honeypots, snort.

Things that triage signals
*  SIEM, eg splunk.

Things that will alert a human 
*  Automatic triage of collated logs, machine learning.
*  Notifications and analyst fatigue.
*  Systems that make it easy to decide if alert is actual hacks or not.

Signatures

Host-based signatures
*  Eg changes to the registry, files created or modified.
*  Strings in found in malware samples appearing in binaries installed on hosts (/Antivirus).

Network signatures
*  Eg checking DNS records for attempts to contact C2 (command and control) servers. 

Anomaly / Behaviour based detection 
*  IDS learns model of “normal” behaviour, then can detect things that deviate too far from normal - eg unusual urls being accessed, user specific*  login times / usual work hours, normal files accessed.  
*  Can also look for things that a hacker might specifically do (eg, HISTFILE commands, accessing /proc).
*  If someone is inside the network*  If action could be suspicious, increase log verbosity for that user.

Firewall rules
*  Brute force (trying to log in with a lot of failures).
*  Detecting port scanning (could look for TCP SYN packets with no following SYN ACK/ half connections).
*  Antivirus software notifications.
*  Large amounts of upload traffic.

Honey pots
*  Canary tokens.
*  Dummy internal service / web server, can check traffic, see what attacker tries.

Things to know about attackers
*  Slow attacks are harder to detect.
*  Attacker can spoof packets that look like other types of attacks, deliberately create a lot of noise.
*  Attacker can spoof IP address sending packets, but can check TTL of packets and TTL of reverse lookup to find spoofed addresses.
*  Correlating IPs with physical location (is difficult and inaccurate often).

Logs to look at
*  DNS queries to suspicious domains.
*  HTTP headers could contain wonky information.
*  Metadata of files (eg. author of file) (more forensics?).
*  Traffic volume.
*  Traffic patterns.
*  Execution logs.

Detection related tools
*  Splunk.
*  Arcsight.
*  Qradar.
*  Darktrace.
*  Tcpdump.
*  Wireshark.

*  How to delegate.
*  Who does what role.
*  How is communication managed + methods of communication.
*  When to stop an attack.
*  Understand risk of alerting attacker.
*  Ways an attacker may clean up / hide their attack.

Important things to know and understand

*  Finding the root cause.
*  Symptom vs Cause.
*  First principles vs in depth systems knowledge (why both are good).

# Learning tips 

[Learning How To Learn course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) is amazing and very useful. Take the full course, or read [this summary on Medium](https://medium.com/learn-love-code/learnings-from-learning-how-to-learn-19d149920dc4).

**Track concepts - "To learn", "Revising", "Done"**
- Any terms I couldn't easily explain went on to post-its. 
- One term per post-it. 
- "To learn", "Revising", "Done" was written on my whiteboard and I moved my post-its between these categories, I attended to this every few days.
- I looked up terms everyday, and I practiced recalling terms and explaining them to myself every time I remembered I had these interviews coming up (frequently).
- I carried around a notebook and wrote down terms and explanations. 

**Target your learning**
- Think *hard* about what specific team you are going for, what skills do they want? If you aren't sure, then ask someone who will definitely know.

**Identify your weaknesses**
- If you're weak on coding and you find yourself avoiding it, then spend most of your study time doing that.

**Read**
- Read relevant books (you don't have to read back to back).
- When looking up things online, avoid going more than two referral links deep - this will save you from browser tab hell.

**Mental health**
- Take care of your basic needs first - sleep, eat well, drink water, gentle exercise. You know yourself, so do what's best for you.
- You are more than your economic output, remember to separate your self worth from your paycheque. 
- See interviews for what they are - they are *not* a measure of you being "good enough".

# Interviewing tips 

**Ask questions**
- Questions create thirst for answers.
- Ask questions to yourself when you’re studying, to the people you are studying with.
- Questions reveal how you approach problems.
- Ask your interviewer lots of questions. They often intentionally ask questions with few details.

**Say what you are thinking**
- The interviewer can only make an evaluation on your suitability for the job based on the things you *say*. 
- If you don't say your thought process aloud, then the interviewer doesn't know what you know. 
- Practice saying everything you know about a topic, even details you think might be irrelevant. 

**Reduce cognitive load**
- If the infrastructure is complicated, draw up what you think it looks like. 
- Write tests and expected output for code you write, test your code against it. 
- Take notes about the questions so you don't forget important details.

**Prepare**
- Prepare questions that you want to ask your interviewers so you don't need to think of them on the spot on the day. Since an interview is also for you to know more about the workplace, I asked questions about the worst part of the job. 
- Bring some small stacks in a box or container that isn't noisy and distracting. A little bit of sugar throughout the day can help your problem solving abilities. 
- Stay hydrated - and take a toilet break between every interview if you need to. 

**Do practice interviews**
- Do them until it's comfortable and you can easily talk through problems
- Ask them to give you really hard questions that you definitely don't know how to answer
- Practice being in the uncomfortable position where you have no idea about the topic you've been asked. Work through it from first principles.
- Doooo theeeeemmm yes they can be annoying to organise but it is **worth it**.

**Interviewers are potential friends and they want to help you get the job, they are on your side. Let them help you, ask them questions, say everything you know on a topic and *say your thought process out loud*.**
